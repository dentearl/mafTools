General approach:

- a series of editing operations on alignment blocks
- multiple editing passes over the data
- alignments are always valid at the end of a pass.



# join duplications blocks in a MAF
joinDups(malnSet)
  - foreach block-A in malnSet:
    - foreach block-B in malnSet where its root component overlaps
              the block A root component:
      - merge block-B into block-A
      - delete block-B.

# load a MAF file into an malnSet
loadMaf(mafFile)
  - convert MAF to an malnSet
  - joinDups(malnSet)

# join two components where the children of belowComp are added to aboveComp
# if belowComp extends beyond the bounds of aboveComp the component, the
# ends are trimmed and added as blocks to pending
joinPair(aboveComp, belowComp, pending)
  - trimToAboveBounds(aboveComp, belowComp, pending)
  - joinBlk = joinBlks(aboveComp, belowComp)
  - aboveComp.markdDeleted()
  - belowComp.markdDeleted()
  - return joinBlk
  

# on pass to join joinBlk with targetSet. block can be derived from the
# joinSet or targetSet, it should not be active in a set.  If a block must be
# split to do the join, the unjoined pieces are added to the pending set.
# Returns updated joinBlk if modified.
joinBlkWithSetPass(guideGenome, joinBlk, targetSet, pending):
  - foreach joinGuideComp in joinBlk:
    - foreach targetGuideComp in targetSet.overlapping(joinGuideComp):
      - if joinGuideComp is root:
        - joinBlk = joinPair(targetGuideComp, joinGuideComp, pending)
      - else 
        - joinBlk = joinPair(joinGuideComp, targetGuideComp, pending)
 - return joinBlk

# make multiple pass over input sets until no more blocks can be joined
# with joinBlk
joinBlkWithSet(guideGenome, joinBlk, malnSet1, malnSet2)
  - until nothing joined:
    - joinBlk = joinBlkWithSetPass(guideGenome, joinBlk, malnSet1, pending):
    - joinBlk = joinBlkWithSetPass(guideGenome, joinBlk, malnSet2, pending):
    - move pending back to approriate sets

# join two sets at guideGenome, prodicing a third
malnJoinSets(guideGenome, malnSet1, malnSet2)
  - foreach blk1 in malnSet1
      joinBlock = blk1.close()
      blk1.markDeleted()
      joinedSet.add(joinBlock);

# join blocks with overlapping or adjacent root components.  Only join
# adjacent roots if there are components that cross the block.  Always join
# overlapping
joinOverlapAdjacent(malnSet)

# merge components in blocks that could be one component
mergeComps(malnSet)
